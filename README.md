# SETI Signal Detection

This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at detecting potential technosignatures of extraterrestrial intelligence in the form of anomalous signals. Data will be in the form of spectrograms provided by the Breakthrough Listen team at the University of California, Berkeley. The main goal of the project is to develop an algorithm that can identify these signals (referred to as "needles") from a dataset containing millions of signals, most of which are radio frequency interference (RFI) from human-made technology.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two-dimensional arrays, or spectrograms, representing the signal intensity as a function of frequency and time. These spectrograms are generated by the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the largest steerable dish on the planet, with a diameter of 100 meters. The dataset is provided in the form of "cadence snippets," which are small regions of the spectrograms containing signals from target stars and other regions of the sky. **The needles are simulated signals hidden within the haystack of data from the telescope.**
